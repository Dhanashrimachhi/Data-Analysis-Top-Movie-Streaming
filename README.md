## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this project, my goal was to exploit the data in all possible ways. After performing some data cleaning (handling null values, etc.), I answered to these questions:
- What is the number of movies for each age group?
- Top 10 languages in Streaming Services?
- Number of movies in specific age group in All services?
- Rotten Tomato Ratings For Overall Services?
- Rotten Tomato Ratings For Each Services?
- IMDB Ratings?
- Count Of Runtimes Of Movies?
- Directors and their Count Of Movies they have Directed?
- Exploring Genres?
- What are the top Movies On Each Platform?
